# MIDAS TASK
  This repository is divided into different parts.
  
   1. Data Collection(Part 1) - It includes code for the collection of data and also includes what all the ways through which I have tried to collect data.
   2. EDA(Part 2) - It includes code for Exploratry Data Analysis. It also generates a file "final_profile.html" created using pandas profiling.
   3. Building a flare detector(Part 3) - In the model folder, I have demonstrated different training and results of different machine learning and deep learning models.
   4. Building a Web Application - In the deploy folder, I have included all the files necessary to build application and deploy on herko.
   5. Deploy - The app is successfully deployed on heroku, but when I am making a request from postman it's not working. I have tried to run the app using gunicorn in my system and it's successfully running, here is the [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KkbIxj4mRA4iRxAqEFcLFKr1uQee3QGv) to prove. But in heroku, it was not working. According to logs, the worker is crashing. I don't know the reason behind worker crashing.                                                 
   Here is the link for the app: https://midasiiitd.herokuapp.com/                                                             
   As the app doesn't have any html template and also it's only available at "/automated_testing" endpoint, so the above link of app is not much useful.
   
   **Note: model folder has it's own readme.md so, please read it**
