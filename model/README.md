# MODELS

## NOTE : I have used Kaggle to run all these above notebooks and link can be found below for the kaggle notebook and saved model weights.


  There are a bunch of models with which I have experimented. It includes machine learning and deep learning both. At the same time I have tried augmentations also like oversampling and paraphrashing.
  
  a) ```machine-learning.ipynb``` - In this notebook, I have experimented with a lot of ML models like SVMs, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and XGBoost. In this notebook I have also shown results after training model with oversamples data. All of the results are shown in notebooks.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/machine-learning))                                                  
  b) ```lstm-dl``` - In this notebook, I have shown the training of LSTM model on the data. The results can be found on the notebook.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/lstm-dl))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  c) ```svm-classifier.ipynb``` - In this notebook, I have described different variants of SVM with different types of vectors. The things which worked and didn't worked also being shown in the notebook.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/svm-classifier))                                            
  d) ```xgboost.ipynb``` - In this notebook, I have trained xgboost model with different hyperparameters and differnt types of vectors. All the results can be seen in the notebook.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/xgboost))                                                                       
  e) ```bert-distilbert.ipynb``` - In this notebook, I have trained two bert models, one is the original bert and other is distilbert. The results can be seen in the notebook.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/bert-distilbert)  )                                                                          
  f) ```augmentation.ipynb``` - In this notebook, I have used rasa library for aumentations. Here, paraphrasing augmentations are used. As all the notebooks are being run on Kaggle, so this notebook took a lot of for creating paraphrases, so the notebook got terminated by the kaggle and because of this the augmentation could not be completed. Actually to reduce time, I divided the data into parts, but still it could not be done, with half the data it took more than 9 hrs and notebook got terminated because of this.([Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakumar01/augmentation1))
